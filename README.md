## Purpose
In this project, the team developed an application that helps you locate breweries and Taco restauarnts in your area of choice.
The team used three different APIs(Open Weather, Open brewey DB, and Documenu) to convert the user's Zipcode to Latitude/Longitude coordinates, then retreive nearby breweries and Mexican restaurants.
Each of the returned results displays the business name, address, website(if available) in addition to brewery categories and restaurant menus.

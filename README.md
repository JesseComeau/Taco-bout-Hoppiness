# Taco 'bout Hoppiness
## Repository to for finding hoppiness

Welcome to Taco'bout Hoppiness. In this project, the team developed an application that helps you locate breweries and Taco restauarnts in your area of choice.
The team used three different APIs(Open Weather, Open brewey DB, and Documenu) to convert the user's Zipcode to Latitude/Longitude coordinates, then retreive nearby breweries and Mexican restaurants.
Each of the returned results displays the business name, address, website(if available) in addition to brewery categories and restaurant menus.

The site currently does the following:

```
Enter a zip code to pull up nearby breweries.

From there, scroll through the displayed brewery cards to select your preferred brewery, and pull up taco places near there.

The taco cards can be scrolled through, and you can pull up the restaurant's taco menu (Work-in-progress).

The modal allows you to save the pairing of brewery and taco restaurant to your favorites.

You can navigate to your favorites tab to pull up your list of favorite pairings with information, and delete whatever pairing as needed.

The site also has an about me section for all members of the Better Booze Bureau.
